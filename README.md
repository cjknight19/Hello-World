**PROJECT TITLE**

Hello World!
- [DESCRIPTION](#Description)

This is my first attempt at figuring out how github works so that I can showcase this to employers
- [HOW TO RUN PROGRAM](#How-to-run-program)

Github is a platform for data analysts and data scientists to use in order to be able to work on a project that involves coding. This platform allows you to share code with members of your team. You run the program by creating a *central repository* where all of the coding is kept. When you are working on something individually you can *push* this code to a remote repository. When someone else makes changes on their computer you can *pull* that information as well to your computer. When you create *branches* this allows you to keep the central repository but make new versions of the code. 
- [FILES USED](#files-used)

The files and data used within Github can be found in the topic section. This section allows you to look at other peoples repositories to see if anything peaks your interest. The files mainly contain code for a variety of different topics. You have to make sure you get your ==repo== from a secure source.
- [VERSIONING](#versioning)

If there is any versions of the code that doesnt work or that conflicts itself its important to know what to do. When pushing code and working on it with multiple people some conflicts may occur. Different versions can be pushed onto the repository that conflict each other. When this happens you will need to designate one person to chose which version of the code is best
